# What is a Software License?
Some short definition

"A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.

Software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating
copyrights. The license also defines the responsibilities of the parties entering into the license agreement and may
impose restrictions on how the software can be used.
